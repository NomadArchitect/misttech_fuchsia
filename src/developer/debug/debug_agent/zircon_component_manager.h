  //
  // HOW TO ASSOCIATE PROCESSES WITH TEST CASES?
  //
  // Fuchsia test runners usually start one process for each test case, and each process has its
  // own stdout and stderr handles. So one test could correspond to many stdio handles.
  //
  // The test framework provides no functionality to associate the stdio with the process, i.e.,
  // it won't tell us the process koid for each test case. To associate outputs with processes,
  // we have to have some assumptions:
  //
  //   * The order of process starting events is the same as the order of test case identifiers.
  //   * The test runner will launch k+n processes, where n is the number of test cases, and the
  //     first k processes are used to inspect the test binary and list available test cases.
  //     As of the writing, k is 1 for gtest runner and k is 2 for rust test runner.
  //   * Gtest tests have "." in the case names and rust tests have "::" in the case names.
  //
  // These are the implementation detail about the test runners, but they are stable: as long as
  // test runners don't change their logic and launch test cases in the order of case identifiers,
  // the delivery of process starting events will be ordered without any flakiness.
  //
  // The overall lifecycle for launching a test will look like
  //
  //   * |TestLauncher::Launch()| inserts a new entry in |running_tests_info_|.
  //   * (a) |OnProcessStart()| receives process starting events for the first k processes.
  //   * For each test cases,
  //     (b) |TestLauncher::OnSuiteEvents()| receives |CaseFound| events, populates |case_names| and
  //         set |ignored_process|.
  //     (c) |OnProcessStart()| receives process starting events and populates |pids|.
  //         If |case_names| is available, it'll override the process name.
  //     (d) |TestLauncher::OnSuiteEvents()| receives |CaseArtifact| events that include the stdout
  //         or stderr handles. If the process is running, it'll |SetStdout| or |SetStderr|.
  //     (e) The process terminates.
  //
  // Only the order of events from the same channel, i.e., (a)(c)(e) or (b)(d), is determined.
  //
  // The worst case of our solution is everything comes out of order. We might
  //
  //   * Fail to attach to the first test case of a gtest because |CaseFound| arrives too late.
  //   * Fail to set the process name to the case name because |CaseFound| arrives too late.
  //   * Fail to set the stdout/stderr handle because the process has terminated.
  //
  // In either way, there won't be mismatch between the test output and the process.
  //
  // NOTE: It's not possible to inspect the handle table of the process and find the socket pair,
  // because the socket we get from test framework is not the opposite side sent to the process.
  //
  // TODO(https://fxbug.dev/42058530): Use a better method to associate processes and test cases.
